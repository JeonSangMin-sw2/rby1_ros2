# Hardware Interface (`rby1_hardware`)

`rby1_hardware/RBY1SystemHardware` is a `ros2_control` `SystemInterface` plugin: a controller manager
(`ros2_control_node`) loads it from the `<ros2_control>` block of the robot's URDF and runs the standard controllers
on it — `joint_trajectory_controller`s per part and a `joint_state_broadcaster`. MoveIt uses it through the
`rby1_moveit_*` `demo.launch.py` ([MoveIt](06_moveit.md#demolaunchpy)); it also works without MoveIt
([below](#using-it-without-moveit)).

## How it is built

- **Two connections to the robot.** The plugin opens its own gRPC connection to the robot for the command streams,
  and talks to the running **driver** for the rest: on activation it calls `/rby1/robot_power` and `/rby1/robot_servo`
  (`power_on`, `servo_on` parameters; default `all`) and claims the **control right** with `/rby1/hardware_control
  state: true`. While it holds the right the driver refuses its own command sources (actions, streams, the examples)
  and keeps publishing the state; on deactivation the plugin cancels its control, closes its streams, waits for the
  robot to go idle, disables the control manager, disconnects and releases the right (`state: false`). The claim is
  asked up to three times (an answer was once lost while the client was still being matched).
- **Streams.** Two SDK command streams: one for the upper body (torso, arms, head, sent as one component-based
  command) and one for the mobile base. An I/O thread sends the latest commanded positions of every joint it maps,
  at the controller manager's rate (100 Hz in the shipped `ros2_controllers.yaml`), with the velocity and acceleration
  limits of the `<ros2_control>` parameters when given.
- **Joints.** Each URDF joint is mapped to an SDK joint by name. A joint the SDK does not have — the finger joints of
  a v1.3 model — is left unmapped: not sent, and its state reads back whatever was commanded (the gripper controller
  is what moves those; [Tools — Gripper](07_tools.md#gripper)). One position command interface and position and
  velocity state interfaces per joint. `read()` sets every command to the measured position each cycle, so a
  controller that is not active leaves its joints where they are.
- **State.** The plugin reads positions and velocities from the robot itself; it also subscribes to the driver's
  `/rby1/joint_overall_states`.
- **The controllers.** The `ros2_controllers.yaml` of each MoveIt package: `right_arm_controller`,
  `left_arm_controller`, `torso_controller`, `head_controller`, `both_arms_controller`, `body_controller` (v1.3 also
  `gripper_r_controller`, `gripper_l_controller`), all `JointTrajectoryController`s with a position command interface,
  and `joint_state_broadcaster`. Two active controllers cannot share a joint, so `both_arms_controller` and
  `right_arm_controller` do not run together; `ros2 control switch_controllers` changes the set at run time.
  Controllers on different parts run at the same time: a trajectory to the right arm while the left arm's runs.

`<ros2_control>` parameters of the plugin, set by the xacro (`RBY1_<M|A>_v<version>.ros2_control.xacro`) from the
launch arguments:

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `robot_ip` | `127.0.0.1:50051` | The robot, the same one the driver is connected to |
| `model` | `m` | `a` or `m` |
| `driver_namespace` | `rby1` | Namespace of the running driver (its services and `joint_overall_states`) |
| `power_on`, `servo_on` | `all` | What the plugin asks the driver to switch on at activation |
| `collision_check_enable`, `collision_threshold` | `false`, `0.01` | Read by the plugin; the driver's own collision check is the one that warns |

> [!WARNING]
> The plugin cannot verify the robot's version. A `rby1_moveit_*` package of another version than the robot gives
> MoveIt and the robot different kinematics; **match the package to the robot** before running on real hardware.

Build: `RBY1_SDK_PATH` must point at the built SDK ([Overview — Install](01_overview.md#install-and-build)); the
CMake stops with a message otherwise.

## Using it without MoveIt

`rby1_hardware.launch.py` starts the controller manager with the robot's URDF, `robot_state_publisher`, the
`joint_state_broadcaster` and the trajectory controllers — nothing of MoveIt. The driver must be running.

```bash
# terminal 1
ros2 launch rby1_driver rby1_ros2_driver.launch.py
# terminal 2
ros2 launch rby1_hardware rby1_hardware.launch.py
ros2 launch rby1_hardware rby1_hardware.launch.py robot_ip:=192.168.30.1:50051     # a robot
ros2 launch rby1_hardware rby1_hardware.launch.py use_fake_hardware:=true          # no robot, no driver (mock hardware)
```

**Which robot** it is for is set at the top of the launch file, not on the command line — three lines to edit for
your RB-Y1:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MOVEIT_CONFIG_PACKAGE` | `rby1_moveit_{a,m}_{1_0,1_1,1_2,1_3}`: the package whose URDF (with the `<ros2_control>` block) and `config/ros2_controllers.yaml` are used. Only its files are read |
| `ROBOT_DESCRIPTION` | its `config/*.urdf.xacro`, e.g. `RBY1_M_v1_2.urdf.xacro` |
| `CONTROLLERS` | the controllers started active (default: `right_arm_controller`, `left_arm_controller`, `torso_controller`, `head_controller`) |

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `robot_ip` | `127.0.0.1:50051` | Robot address and gRPC port |
| `driver_namespace` | `rby1` | Namespace of the running driver |
| `use_fake_hardware` | `false` | `true`: `mock_components/GenericSystem` instead of the robot |

From then on it is plain `ros2_control`: joint states on `/joint_states`, a trajectory to
`/<controller>/follow_joint_trajectory` (`control_msgs/action/FollowJointTrajectory`) or
`/<controller>/joint_trajectory`, `ros2 control list_controllers`,
`ros2 control switch_controllers --deactivate right_arm_controller --activate both_arms_controller`. Ctrl+C on the
launch deactivates the plugin and returns the control right to the driver. Not together with a `demo.launch.py` (one
controller manager per robot). In `rby1_bringup` this is the `ROS2_CONTROL` flag.

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /right_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory control_msgs/action/FollowJointTrajectory \
  "{trajectory: {joint_names: [right_arm_0, right_arm_1, right_arm_2, right_arm_3, right_arm_4, right_arm_5, right_arm_6],
     points: [{positions: [0.0, -0.1, 0.0, -0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], time_from_start: {sec: 3}}]}}"
```

Simulator (2026-10-30): the launch started and stopped three times in a row, each time with the control right
claimed and released; trajectories to each arm, the head and the torso through their controllers all reached their
targets. Not run on a real robot.

## Real-time scheduling

`ros2_control_node` sets `SCHED_FIFO` priority 50 for itself at start when the user may (`realtime_tools`), and
otherwise warns and runs with normal scheduling. To allow it, give the user real-time rights and log in again:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "$USER - rtprio 99" > /etc/security/limits.d/99-realtime.conf; echo "$USER - memlock unlimited" >> /etc/security/limits.d/99-realtime.conf'
```

The log then says `Successful set up FIFO RT scheduling policy with priority 50`. No `chrt` prefix is needed — the
launch files had one until 2026-10-30, which made the node fail to start without rights instead of warning.
